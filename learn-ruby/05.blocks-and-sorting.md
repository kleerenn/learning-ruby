# Method

- a reusable section of code written to perform a specific task in a program
- ```def``` : to define method, followed by the name of method
- ends with the ```end``` keyword
```rb
def welcome
    puts "welcome!!!"
end

welcome
# welcome!!!
```

# Parameters and arguments
```rb
def square(n)
    put n ** 2
end

square(12)
# pass the artument '12' to the parameter 'n'
```
- used ( ) - usually optional but good to use for readability.
- the argument is the piece of code you actually put between the method's parentheses
- the parameter is the name you put between the method's parentheses when you define it.
-

# splat arguments
- arguments preceded by a ```*```, which tell the program that the method can receieve pne or more arguments.
```rb
def what_up(greeting, *friends)
  friends.each { |friend| puts "#{greeting}, #{friend}!" }
end

what_up("What up", "Ian", "Zoe", "Zenas", "Eleanor")
# first arg - 'greeting' will take it
# rest of them - *friends in array
```

# Return
- to make the method to hand us back a value

# Blocks are like Nameless Methods
- bloacks can be defined with either keywords ```do``` and ```end``` or with ```{}```.
- method can be invoked by calling its name
- block will be called *once*.
```rb
[1,2,3,4].each { |item| puts item }
```
- ```each```method takes a block as a parameter. 
- passing a block to a method is a great way to *absctracting* certain tasks from the methods and defining those tasks when calling the method.

# Sorting arrays
- ```.sort!```: sort in ascending(number, alpabetical)
- sort in ascending order by default
- use ```.reverse!``` for descending order.

# The Combined Comparion Operator
- ``` <=> ```: returns 
    - 0 if the first operand equals the second
    - 1 if the first operand is greater than the second
    - -1 if the first operand is less than the second

```rb
def alphabetize(arr, rev=false)
  if rev
    arr.sort { |item1, item2| item2 <=> item1 }
  else
    arr.sort { |item1, item2| item1 <=> item2 }
  end
end

books = ["Heart of Darkness", "Code Complete", "The Lorax", "The Prophet", "Absalom, Absalom!"]

puts "A-Z: #{alphabetize(books)}"
puts "Z-A: #{alphabetize(books, true)}"
```
