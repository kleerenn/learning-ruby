# A simpler 'If'
```rb
if condition
    # do something
end

# or 

expression if bollean
```
- if / end can be in a single line
- an expression dollowed by if
- the order is important!
- no need an ```end```
```rb
if true puts "test"  # NOT this
puts "test" if true # But this
```
# The One-line Unless
- the same order as ```if``` at the end
- no need an ```end```

# Ternary
- takes three arguments: a boolena, an epxression to evaluate if the boolean is true/false
```rb
puts 3 < 4 ? "3 is less than 4" : "3 is not less than 4"
```
- no need an ```end```

# When and Then: the Case Statement
- when there is a lot of conditions to check
- use ```case``` statement
```rb
case language
    when "JS"
        puts "js"
    when "python"
        puts "python"
    else 
        puts "no idea"
end

# Or

case language
    when "js" then puts "js"
    when "python" then puts "python"
    else puts "no idea"
end
```

# conditional Assignment
- ```||=```: to assign a variable if it's hasn't already been assigned.
```rb
favorite_book = nil
puts favorite_book
# (print nothing)

favorite_book ||= "Cat's Cradle"
puts favorite_book
# Cat's Cradle

favorite_book ||= "Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby"
puts favorite_book
# Cat's Cradle
```

# Implicit Return
- if you don't tell a funtion what to return, it will return the result of the last evaluated expression.
- without ```return``` keyword, still can get the value returned
```rb
def add(a + b)
    a + b
    # the last evaluated expression
    # will be returned
end
```

```rb
def first_n_primes(n)
  return "n must be an integer." unless n.is_a? Integer
  return "n must be greater than 0." unless n > 0
  Prime.first n # here return keyword is unnecessary
end

first_n_primes(10)
```

# Short-Circuit Evaluation
``` false && true```
- ruty doesn't look at both expressions because it knows ```false &&``` will return anything as false. 

```rb
def a
  puts "A"
  return true
end

def b
  puts "B"
  return true
end
puts a || b
# A
# doesn't check function b because a already returned value in OR condition.
```

# Loop
- when there is a specific number of times to loop: ```.times```
- when repeating an action for every element: ```.each```

# Up the Down Staircase
- If we know that range of numbers to include
- can use for letters
```rb
95.upto(100) {|n| print n} # 95 69 79 89 99 100
95.downto(90) {|n| print n} # 95 94 93 92 91 90
"L".upto("P") {|e| print e} # L M N O P
```

# Call and Response
- ```.respond_to?```: takes a symbol and returns true if an object can receive that method and false otherwise.
```rb
[1,2,3].respond_to?(:push)
# array can take push method
# return true

[1,2,3].respond_to?(:to_sym)
# array cant take to_sym method
# return false
```

# Push to arrays
- ```.push``` or ```<<```(concatenation operator, the shovel)
- works on strings
```rb
[1,2,3] << 4
# [1,2,3,4]

"karen" << "lee"
# karen lee
```

# String Interpolation
```rb
drink = "coffee"
"i like" + drink

# Or

"i like" << drink

# Or

"i like #{drink}" # string interpolation
```
- place the variable name inside ```#{}``` within a string
