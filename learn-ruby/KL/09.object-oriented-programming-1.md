# Class

- Ruby manipulates programmning constructs called objects.
- Objects have methods and attributes, which are just data.

```rb
"Lee".length #4
# length : methods
# arritube: 4
```

- A class is a way of organizing and producing objects with similar attriubutes and methods.

- Syntax

```rb
class Car
    def initialize(make, model)
        @make = make
        @model = model
    end
end

car = Car.new("subaru", "coolcar")
```

- class names use CamelCase
- ```initialize``` boots up each object the class creates.
- use ```@``` before a variable to signify that it's an *instance variable*, meaning the variable is atached to the instance of the class. not reachable outside of class.
- Instantiating by calling ```.new``` on the class.

# Variable Scope

- ```@```: instance variable
- ```@@```: class variable, belonging to the class itself instead of an instance of a class.
  - it's attached to entired classes.
- ```$```: gloval variable - reachable outside of method.

```rb
class Person
  @@people_count = 0
  
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @@people_count += 1
  end
  
  def self.number_of_instances
    return @@people_count
  end
end

matz = Person.new("Yukihiro")
# instance1
dhh = Person.new("David")
# instance2

puts "Number of Person instances: #{Person.number_of_instances}"
# peole_count is shared with instance of class.
# its value is not just attached to the instance of classes. 
```

# Inheritance

- The process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another.
- The class can have only one superclass(parent)

```rb
class DerivedClass < BaseClass
end

# same as
class DerivedClass < BaseClass; end
```

- use ```<``` as "inherits from"

# Override

- Interits the class and not only take on the methods and attributs of its parents(superclass), override on or more of them.

- ```Super``` keyword
- to directly acccess the attributes or methods of a superclass

```rb
class DerivedClass < Base
    def method_test
        super(args)
        end
    end
end

# example
class Message 
  @@messages_sent = 0
  def initialize(from, to)
    @from = from 
    @to = to 
    @@messages_sent +=1 
  end
end

class Email < Message
  def initialize(from, to)
    super
  end
end

my_message = Message.new("Ian", "Alex")

```

# mixins

- to incorporate data or behavior from several classes into a single class
