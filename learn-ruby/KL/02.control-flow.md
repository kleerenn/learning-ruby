# IF

- takes an expression that evaluates to either ```true``` or ```false```.
- if it's ```true``` excutes the block of code following if
- if not, it skips and goes on to the next thing
- when you are done with ```if```, finish it by typing ```end```
- or finish it by having it at the last

```rb
if 3 < 5
    print "3 is less than 5"
end

problem = true
print "oh....." if problem
```

# Else

- ```if xxx```, ```else yyy```
- if this expression is true, run this code blockl otherwise run the code after the else.

```rb
if 1 > 2
    print "false. so no print"
else 
    print "it will be printed"
end
```

# Elsif

- to add any number of alternatives to an ```if```/```else``` statement

```rb
if x < y
    puts "x < y"
elsif x > y
    puts " x > y"
else 
    puts "x = y"
end
```

# Unless

- check if something is *false*

``` rb
unless sleepy
    print "study"
else 
    print "go to bed"
end
```

- the block can be finished by having unless at the end

```rb problem = false
print "good to go" unless problem 
```

# Equal or Not

- use the comparator ```==``` : is equal to

``` rb
x = 2
y = 2
if x == y
    print "it's equal"
end
```

- ```!=``` : is *not* equal to
- ```.eql(a)?```: return true or false. it checks the type as well as the value.

# Less Than or Grater Than

- less than: ```<```
- less than or equal to: ```<=```
- greater than: ```>```
- greater than or equal to: ```>=```

# And, Or, Not

- and ```&&```: result in boolean value
- inclusive or ```||```: evaluates to true when one or the other or both expressions are true.
- ```!``` makes true values false and vice-versa
