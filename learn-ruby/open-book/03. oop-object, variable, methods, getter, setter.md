# Why Object Oriented Programming?

## Encapsulation

- hiding pieces of functionality and making it unavailable to the rest of the code base. It is a form of data protection, so that data cannot be manipulated or changed without obvious intention. It is what defines the boundaries in your application and allows your code to achieve new levels of complexity

## Polymorphism

- the ability for different types of data to respond to a common interface
- "Poly" stands for "many" and "morph" stands for "forms". OOP gives us flexibility in using pre-written code for new purposes.

## Inheritance

- where a class inherits the behaviors of another class, referred to as the superclass. This gives Ruby programmers the power to define basic classes with large reusability and smaller subclasses for more fine-grained, detailed behaviors
