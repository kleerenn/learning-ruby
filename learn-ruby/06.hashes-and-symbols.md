# Nil
- non-true value
- ```false``` means 'not true'
```nul``` means 'nothing at all'

# Setting Default to Hash
```rb
my_hash = Hash.new("hi")
```
- when trying to access a non-existent key in the hash, you will get the default value.


# Symbols
```rb
menagerie = { 
  :foxes => 2,
  :giraffe => 1,
  :weezards => 17,
  :elves => 1,
  :canaries => 4,
  :ham => 1
}
```
- ```.object_id```: to get the id of object. 
- symbols start with a colon and valid varilable names.
- used either as hash keys or for referencing method names.
    - immutable, they can't be changed once they are created.
    - only one copy of any symbol exists, so they have memory.
    - symbol-as-keys are faster than string-as-keys 

- ```.to_s```: convert to string
- ```.to_sym```, ```.intern```: conver to symbol

# Hash syntax changed 
```rb
new_has = {
    one: 1,
    two: 2
}
```
- put colon at the end of symbol
- no need the has rocket(```=>```)

# .select
- use ```.select``` to filter a hash for values that meet certain criteria
- returns a new filtered array
```rb
grades = {
    alice: 100,
    bob: 2,
    lee: 30
}
grades.select{ |name, grade|
    grade < 10
}
# { :bob => 2 }
```

# .each_key, .each_value
- iterate over just keys or values
```rb
my_hash = {one: 1, two: 2}
my_hash.each_key { |k| print k } # one two
my_hash.each_value { |v| print v} # 1 2
```

# the Case Statement
```rb
case language
    when "js"
        print "websites"
    when "python"
        print "ai"
    when "ruby"
        print "web app"
    else 
        print "no idea"
end
```

# Delete key/value pair
- ```.delete(key symbol)```
