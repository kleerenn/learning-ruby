# Variable Scope

- A variable's scope determines where in a program a variable is avaialble for use.
- Defined by where it's initialized or created.
- variable scope is defined by a **method definition** or by a **block**.

## Method Definition

```rb
name = "kim"
def print_full_name(first_name, last_name)
    name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
    puts name
end
print_full_name('karen', 'lee') # karen lee
print_full_name('bomey', 'lee') # bomey lee
puts name # kim
```

- Methods have self-contained scope, meatning that only variables initialzed within the method's body can be referenced or modified from within the moethod's body.
- Variables initialized inside a method are not avaialble outside the method.
- Locally scoped to methods.

# Blocks

- ```{ }``` or ```do```...```end```

```rb
# block
total = 0
[1,2,3].each {|n| total += n }
puts total # 6 

total = 0
[1,2,3].each do |n|
    total += n # 6
end
```

- The code can access and modify variables that are defined outside of the block.
  - In example, both blocks can access and modify ```total```.
  - Any variables initialed inside the block ```number``` cant be accessed by the outer code.

- **Inner scope can access variables initialzed in an outer scope but not vice versa.**

```rb
a = 5
3.times do |n|
  a = 3
  # can access outside of the block 
  # re-assianged the value of a
end
puts a # 3
```

- ```do...end```: block

- ```for```, ```while``` is not a block, meaning it does not create a new inner scope, since ```for``` is part of Ruby language not a method invoation.

  - when we use ```each```, ```time``` and opther method invocation, followed by ```{}``` or ```do..end```, that's when a new block is created.

```rb
arr = [1,2,3]
for i in arr do 
  a = 5
end
puts a # 5. a is accessible
```
