# While

- f a certain condition is true and ```while``` it is, the loop keeps running.

```rb
i = 0
while i < 5
    puts i
    i += 1
end
```

# Until

- like a backward ```while```

```rb
i = 0
until i == 6
    puts i
    i += 1
end
```

# Assignment Operatoers

- ```+=```, ```-=```, ```*=```. ```/=```
- but there is no ```++``` or ```--```

# For

```rb
for num in 1...10
    puts num
end
```

- use ```...``` or ```..``` in the range.
  - it's ```Range``` class.
  - ```for num in 1...10```: three dots means 'go up to but don't include 10"
  - ```for num in 1..10``` : two dots to include the highest number in the range.
    - by using ```.to_a``` it can be converted to array.

# Loop method

- And iterator is a method that repeatedly invokes a block of code.

```rb
loop { print "hello world"}
# infinitely print the string.
```

- ```{ }``` is interchangeable with the keyword ```do, end```

```rb
i = 0
loop do
    i += 1
    print "#{i}"
    break if i > 5 
end
```

- ```break```: to break a loop as soon as its condition is met.

# Next

- used to skip over certain steps in the loop.

```rb
for i in 1..5
    next if i % 2 == 0
    print i
end
```

# .each Iterator

- can apply and expression to each element of an object.

```rb
object.each { |item|
    print "#{item}"
}

# item is an variable name for each element.

# or 

object.each do |item|
    print "#{item}"
end
```

# .times Iterator

- to perform a tack on each item in an object a specified number of times.

```rb
3.times{ print "ruby" }
# rubyrubyruby
```

# .split

- it takes in a string and returns an array.
- will divide the string wherever it sees the param, called a delimiter.

```rb
test.split(",")
```
