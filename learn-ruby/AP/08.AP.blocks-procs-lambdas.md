# Ruby blocks
- Block syntax uses `do...end` or `{}`

```rb
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num
end
# ==> Prints 1, 2, 3 on separate lines
 
[1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num }
# ==> Prints 1, 2, 3 on separate lines
```

# Collect
- takes a block and applies the expression in the block to every element in an array
- `Collect` method does not mutate the original array, but rather returns a copy of it.
- If we want to mutate the original array, then we can use `collect!`


```rb
my_nums = [1, 2, 3]
my_nums.collect { |num| num ** 2 }
# ==> [1, 4, 9]
```

```rb
my_nums
# ==> [1, 2, 3]
```

```rb
my_nums.collect! { |num| num ** 2 }
# ==> [1, 4, 9]
my_nums
# ==> [1, 4, 9]
```

# Learning to Yield
- Some methods accept a block and others don't because methods that accepts blocks
have a way of transferring control from the calling method to the block and back again.

- We can buld this into the methods we define by using the `yield` keyword.

```rb
def block_test
  puts "We're in the method!"
  puts "Yielding to the block..."
  yield
  puts "We're back in the method!"
end

block_test { puts ">>> We're in the block!"}

#We're in the method!
#Yielding to the block...
#>>> We're in the block!
#We're back in the method!
````

# Keeping your Code Dry (Procs)
- `Blocks` are not objects, and this is a very few exceptions to the "Everything is an object" rule in Ruby.
- `Blocks` cannot be saved into a variable. 
- `Procs` acts like `blocks` but they can be saved into a variable.

- Create procs and assign it to cube:
```rb
cube = Proc.new { |x| x ** 3 }
```

- pass the `procs` into method:

```rb
[1, 2, 3].collect!(&cube)
# ==> [1, 8, 27]
[4, 5, 6].map!(&cube)
# ==> [64, 125, 216]
```

- `.collect!` and `.map!` does the same thing --> applies what ever in the block to the array
- `&` is used to convert `proc` into a `block`

# Why Procs?
- Procs are objects, so they have all the power and abilities of objects (`Blocks` don't)
- Unlike blocks, procs can be called over and over without rewriting them. 
- We can call `procs` directly by calling `.call`.

```rb
test = Proc.new { # does something }
test.call
# does that something!
```

# Symbols Meet Procs

```rb
strings = ["1", "2", "3"]
nums = strings.map(&:to_i)
# ==> [1, 2, 3]
```

# Lmbda
- Like procs, lambdas are objects. 
- Difference is in syntax and small behavioral difference, but identical to procs

```rb
lambda { puts "Hello!" }
```

VS. 

```rb
Proc.new { puts "Hello!" }
```
