# Blocks
- Block syntax uses either ```do..end``` or curly braces (```{}```)
Blocks can be combined with methods like ```.each``` and ```.times``` to execute an instruction for each element in a collection (like a hash or array).

# Collect
- takes a block and applies the expression in the block to every element in an array
```rb
my_nums.collect! { |num| num ** 2 }
# ==> [1, 4, 9]
my_nums
# ==> [1, 4, 9]
```

# Yield
- methods that accept blocks have a way of transferring control from the calling methods to the block and back again.
```rb
def block_test
  puts "We're in the method!"
  puts "Yielding to the block..."
  yield # back to calling methods
  puts "We're back in the method!"
end

block_test { puts ">>> We're in the block!" }
# We're in the method!
# Yielding to the block...
# >>> We're in the block!
# We're back in the method!
```

```rb
def yield_name(name)
  puts "In the method! Let's yield."
  yield("Kim") # back to calling method and pass "Kim"
  puts "In between the yields!"
  yield(name)
  puts "Block complete! Back in the method."
end

yield_name("Eric") { |n| puts "My name is #{n}." }
# gets passed arguments from yield by n

```

# Procs
- a saved block
- name a clock and urn it into a proc to keet the code DRY.
- define proces
```rb
cube = Proc.new { |x| x ** 3 }
```
- you can pass the proc to a menthod that expects a block
- add ```&``` to conver the proc into a block.
```rb
[1,2,3].collect!(&cube)
```
- full-fledged objects, they have powers and abilities of objects.
- unlike block, procs can be called over and over without rewriting them. 
- prevents from having to retype the contents of your block to execute a particular bit of code.
```rb
def greeter
  yield 
end

phrase = Proc.new{ puts "Hello there!" }

greeter(&phrase)
# Hello there!
```

## call procs directly
- ```.call```
```rb
test = Proc.new{ puts "call" }
test.call
# call
```

# Symbols and procs
- convert symbols to procs using ```&```
```rb
strings = ["1", "2", "3"]
nums = strings.map(&:to_i) 
# passing symbol
# convert to proc using &

# ==> [1, 2, 3]
```

# Lambda
- lambdas are objects. identical to procs ```lambda { |param| block }```
```rb
Proc.new { puts "hi" }

# same as
lambda { puts "hi" } 

hi = lambda { puts "hi" }
hi.call
# hi
``` 

## Lambdas vs. Procs
- a lambda checks the number of arguments passed to it / procs does not.
- a lambda will throw an error if the wrong number of arguments are passed / proc will ignore unexpected arguments and assign ```nil``` to any that are missing.
- when a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method / a procs returns it does so immediately without going back to the calling method.
```rb
def batman_ironman_proc
  victor = Proc.new { return "Batman proc" } # return immediately
  victor.call
  "Iron Man proc"
end

puts batman_ironman_proc
# Batman proc

def batman_ironman_lambda
  victor = lambda { return "Batman lambda" } # go back to method
  victor.call
  "Iron Man lambda" # return the last code it evaluates
end

puts batman_ironman_lambda 
# Iron man lambda
```

## check type
```.is_a? Symbol```,```.is_a? Integer``` 


# check!
- when to use yield?
- find stack docs on procs, lambda 
```
odds_n_ends = [:weezard, 42, "Trady Blix", 3, true, 19, 12.345]

check_integer = lambda { |e| e.is_a? Integer }

ints = odds_n_ends.select(&check_integer) // cant to check_integer.call???
puts ints
```
