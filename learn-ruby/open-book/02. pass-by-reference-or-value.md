# Pass by Reference vs Pass by Value

## Pass by Value

- the method only has a copy of the original object.
- Operations performed on the object within the method have no effect on the original object outside of the method.

```rb
def change_name(name)
  name = 'bob'   
  # inner scope. no access to outside of method
end

name = 'jim'
change_name(name) # not passed by reference but value
puts name # jim
```

## Pass by Reference

```rb
def cap(str)
  str.capitalize!  
  # re-assinging str using !
  # operations within the method affected the original object
end

name = "jim"
cap(name)
puts name  #Jim
```

- **when an operation within the method mutates the caller, it will affect the original object.**
