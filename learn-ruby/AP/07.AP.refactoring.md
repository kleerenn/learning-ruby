# A Simpler 'If'
- There is a simpler way to use `If` statement if compared to a `boolean` value. 

- IMPORTANT: The simpler way of writing If statement can ONLY work with boolean values. It only works when expression is followed by `boolean` values.

I. Traditional If statement:
```rb
    if condition
        #Do something
    end
```
II. Simpler If statement:
```rb
   puts "It's true!" if true
```
III. CANNOT use simpler If statement LIKE THIS:
```rb
    if true puts "It's true!
```

- `Boolean` needs to follow `after expression`.

# A Simpler "Unless"
- Same rule applies from `If statement above`

```rb
puts "Hello World" unless true
```

# Ternary Operators
- More concise version of `if/else` statement.

```rb
    puts 3<4 ? "When true!" : "When false"
```

# Case Statement
- Long `if/elsif` can bogg down performance.
- `Case statement` is short and concise compared to `if/elsif` .

```rb
 case language
    when "Js"
        puts "Websites!"
    when "Ruby"
        puts "web apps!"
    else
        puts "I don't know!"
end
```
# Conditional Assignment
 - If we want to assign a variable that hasn't been already assigned use `||=`.

 ```rb
    my_favorite_food =nil
    my_favorite_food ||= "English"
    puts  my_favorite_food
 ```

 - What ||= essentially does in the example above, is that if my_favorite_food is `falsy` value, then assign "English" to my_favorite food variable.

 # Implicit Return
- If method does not `return` anything in Ruby, it will return the result of the last evaluated expression.

```rb
    def add(a,b)
        a+b
    end
```
- As you can see, there is no `return` statement, however ruby will still return the final result of a+b.

# Short-circuit Evaluation
- Ruby evaulates in short-circuit when logical operators are used like `&&` or `||`.

```rb 
    false && true
```
- From the above example, Ruby will stop reading as soon as it sees `false` because if `false` anything that comes after that will still be `false`.

# Using for loop vs. times
- If we want to repat an action for every element in a collection, use `.times`

- times:
```rb
    5.times {puts "Odelay!}
``` 

- If we want to repat an action for every element in a collection, we can use `.each`

- each:
```rb
    [1,2,3].each {|x| puts x*10}
```
# .upto and .downto
- if we know the range of numbers or alphabet, we can use `upto` and `downto`

```rb
    95.upto(100) {|num| print num, ""}
```

# .respond_to?
- `respond_to?` will take symbol and return a `boolean` value if the object can take the method or not

```rb
    [1,2,3].respond_to?(:push)
    #Will Return True because you can use push into an array object
```

```rb
    [1,2,3].respond_to?(:symbol)
    #Will return False because you can turn an array object into a symbol
```

# .next

- `next` method will return integer immediately following the integer it's called on. 

```rb
    my_age = 30
    puts my_age.next
    #This will put 31
```

# Alternative to using `.push` method
- You can use `<<` aka the shovel to add an element to the end of the array

```rb
    [1,2,3] <<4
    # ==> this will return [1,2,3,4]
```

# String interpolation
- You can use `+` or `<<` to add variable value to a string
- If you are trying to add non-string value to a string value, you have to use `to_s` to convert it to a string first

```rb
age = 26
"I am " + age.to_s + " years old."
    # ==> "I am 26 years old."
"I am " << age.to_s << " years old."
    # ==> "I am 26 years old."
```

- Best way to use *string interpolation* is use `#{}`
```rb
"I love #{drink}."
    # ==> I love espresso.
"I am #{age} years old."
    # ==> I am 26 years old. 
```
